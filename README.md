# handwritten-alphabet-recognition

This is a mini project to recognize handwritten alphabets using Keras CNN model.

using this model architecture, I have acheived 98% training accuracy, 99% validation accuracy and 99% test accuracy.

Split used in data(train : validation : test) is 0.6 : 0.24 : 0.16.

NOTE : Data used in this exercise, was taken from the kaggle.com
Note : If you want to exercise this, either download the data on your local repository or run it on kaggle.

may the data be with you :)
